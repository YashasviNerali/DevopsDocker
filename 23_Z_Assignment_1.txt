Your supermarket company is working on expanding their Docker infrastructure. They have an existing service that provides a list of fruit sold in their stores. After measuring the amount of load on this service, they have asked you to scale this service up to a higher number of replicas.

In addition, there is a new service that provides a list of vegetables. This new service needs to be created in the cluster. Set up the swarm cluster to complete the lab, ensure that the swarm meets the following specifications:
----------------------------
# Set up a docker swarm & worker nodes first
   $ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.17.0.32
   Swarm initialized: current node (1hwc7tyrdg7n1n17th9czsfal) is now a manager.
# add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:
    $ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-31kezav5e6cwejxjyu1uvpkdbdtcxvinu07seaonornc9vp7dr-eb0ajzs51iyq78lckxpjx80c4 172.17.0.32:2377

node01 $ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-31kezav5e6cwejxjyu1uvpkdbdtcxvinu07seaonornc9vp7dr-eb0ajzs51iyq78lckxpjx80c4 172.17.0.32:2377
This node joined a swarm as a worker.
	
==========================

1. Scale the service called products-fruit to 5 replicas.
# create a service so that it becomes easy to kep replicas which means high acvaialability in case any container service goes down
docker service scale products-fruit=5
or
docker service create --name products-fruit -p 8080:80 linuxacademycontent/fruit-service


2. Create a new service called products-vegetables running the linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0 image.
# crete a service of vegetable-service image where container runs on 8081
docker service create --name products-vegetables -p 8081:80 linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0 

3. Publish products-vegetables on port 8081. The application listens on port 80.
#transfers data to & from network service using protoco; like https ,http etc
#should display all vegetable list on cli 
curl http://172.17.0.32:8081

4. Run products-vegetables with 3 replicas.
# let service have 3 replicas of vegetables on any node 
docker service update --replicas 3 products-vegetables


You can test the products-fruit service from any swarm node (including the manager) with curl localhost:8080.
#displays all fruits, try on manager 7 worker node aswell
$ curl http://172.17.0.32:8080
# o/p-
{
  "description": "A list of fruits.",
  "fruits": [
    "apple",
    "apricot",
    "avocado",
    "banana",


Once products-vegetables is running, you should be able to test it from any swarm node (including the manager) with curl localhost:8081.
#displays all vegetables, try on manager 7 worker node aswell
$ curl http://172.17.0.32:8081
# o/p --
{
    "description": "A list of vegetables.",
    "vegetables": [
        "acorn squash",
        "alfalfa sprout",
        "amaranth",
